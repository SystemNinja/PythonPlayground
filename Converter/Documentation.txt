To add: Currency(euro-din+reverse,euro-dollar+reverse,euro/din-yen+reverse). Imperial to Metric unit converter.

euro to din and vice versa -- done
Celsius to Fahrenheit F = C × 9/5 + 32. --  done 
Fahrenheit to Celsius C = F - 32 * 5/9, -- done 
meter to feet, 1ft=0.3048m, 1m=3.28084 feet -- done
kg to pound 1kg=2.20462262185lb, divider=0.45359237 -- done 
cm to inches 1cm=2.54inches -- done
km to miles 1 kilometer is equal to 0.62137119 miles. divider=1.609344 -- done

***Currency Converter***
Limit program to lets say 3 decimals behind zero, for that discover about decimals for added precision, for now use round function, 
format() can also be used to accomplish same task
Currencies(9.12.2017): Euro: 119.643din Dollar: 101.659din

Challenges/Improvements:
Make program use loops, dictionaries, basically all parts covered up until lesson 6(not including it)
Add feature to 'length' section which will perform calculations based on 1 parameter, ex: 
    #Enter number of km and return equivalent in mi, m, ft,etc. 
Modify currency converter so that it pulls course from internet

    Some sites generate content after load via javascript, therefore data needs to be obtained by different method, ex: selenium

    Bonus bonus, in case there's no net, make program use course from last time the net connection was established.
        Most likely requires writing a value to a file and then reads from it

Modify Celsius and Fahrenheits so values below certain points cannot be entered stating that temperature cannot be below "a point", points:
    C - lowest temp cannot be below -273
    F - lowest temp cannot be below -459

Questions:
1-Should multiple functions be used or try to fit all code into one function? Example CurrencyConverter function, it handles menu options and calls function based on which option is selected.
Should I remove functions which convert euro to din and vice-versa and incorporate code into function CurrencyConverter?
Function will be called only if choosen by options from menu.

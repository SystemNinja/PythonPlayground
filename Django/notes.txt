Databases for production environment
Default sqlite3 is good for testing/small scale projects

Django built-in web server
Don’t use this server in anything resembling a production environment. It’s intended only for use while developing.
Instead use apache or nginx or maybe docker.

Steps for creating model
Change your models (in models.py).
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
The reason that there are separate commands to make and apply migrations is because you’ll commit migrations to your version control system and ship them with your app;
they not only make your development easier, they’re also usable by other developers and in production.
Read the django-admin documentation for full information on what the manage.py utility can do.

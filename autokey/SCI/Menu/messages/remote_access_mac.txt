When asked for code, type:


Download and install ConnectWise Control/ScreenConnect app and run it.
Application will ask you to grant it Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions.
If you are not prompted right away, open System Preferences then click on Security & Privacy.
Click on Privacy tab then look for Screen Recording, you may have to click on the lock icon in order to make changes.
On the right side locate ConnectWise application and click on the checkbox in front of it.
Now look for the Accessibility menu on the left side and repeat the steps.
